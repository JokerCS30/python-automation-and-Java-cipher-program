Monday plans for coding:

 - integrate scripts into one big one where it prompts me on which one I want to run, so I press one macro button and it gives me all the scripts to run.

 - add to my CSGO chat bots.

 - Maybe setup a script which asks whether people want jokes, riddles, a story or someones profile skimmed.
