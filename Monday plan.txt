Monday plans for coding:

 - integrate scripts into one big one where it prompts me on which one I want to run, so I press one macro button and it gives me all the scripts to run.

 - add to my CSGO chat bots.

 - Maybe setup a script which asks whether people want jokes, riddles, a story or someones profile skimmed. 
  
 - add to main script, functions which will write a message explaining how I scraped their profile and proving I wrote the code, then referring them to my github
 
 - function to print out definition of skid / script kiddie and reasons I donâ€™t come under that name.

 - function to auto write some terminology and ask person to explain it. 

 - fake program to pretend I have wallhacks, aimbot etc:

csgo.api(loadWallhacks);
csgo.api(loadAimBot);
csgo.api(loadSpinBot);

import aimware;
ambit = True;
wallHacks = True;

if cunt.getSalty(){
	spinbot = True;
	wallbangWaim = True;
}
