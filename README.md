# CSGO-chat-automation-scripts
python scripts to automate things in csgo, chatbots with webscraping mainly
also some python networking stuff, the wifi python scripts are not complete at all.

Java folder contains the java files part of one program which is for ciphering, deciphering, converting and scrambling text. Plan to add more analytical function to it, maybe a frequency analysis method.

The bash script MonitorMode is to Automate setting NIC into monitoring mode, changing mac address to random and killing all running network services. 
Protoype is the bash script I have been creating to automate wifi cracking however have an issue I can't resolve yet with it. The plan is to have it autorun on my portable raspberry pi without needing any manual input. 

Mainly using Beautiful Soup and pyautogui the CSGO python scripts will create macros, webscrape info, auto steam message, auto shoot 360(not aimbot), spin etc

If people want to say I didn't code any of this myself this github is proof :). However the csgo python scripts are incredibly simple and easy. I made most of them in minutes without caring much about their structure or good coding practices beacuse it really didn't matter. My biggest programming project was the java program shifting and converting which I worked on alot over time to add more functions and tidy up etc.

My steam names are; J0K3R, Salty Riddles and Scarecrow.
