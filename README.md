# CSGO-chat-automation-scripts
python scripts to automate things in csgo, mainly creating macros

Mainly using Beautiful Soup and pyautogui these scripts will create macros, webscrape info, auto steam message, auto shoot, spin etc

If people want to say I didn't code any of this myself this github is proof :). However these csgo python scripts are incredibly simple and easy. I made most of them in minutes without caring much about their structure or good coding practices beacuse it really didn't matter. My biggest programming project was the java program shifting and converting which I worked on alot over time to add more functions and tidy up etc.

My steam names are; J0K3R, Salty Riddles and Scarecrow.
