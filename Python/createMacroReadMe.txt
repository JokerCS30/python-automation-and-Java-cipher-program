createMacro.py:

this script is to interact with and automate creating a macro in the macro program - Mouse Recorder Premium
it uses similar functions from autoType in order to take info off their steam profile except it doesn't take most played game
and only prints out the first 10 friends on their list as to not spam the chat for too long. Using pyautogui it adds in the text to be 
written in the macro on a template I already created in Mouse Recorder. The text written at the end with a fake .onion link is 
completely made up and c('Results = one. please subscribe to our services for the raw data.') is the bait where people assume its from 
genuine search on the internet due to the subscribe for raw data. One person tried to say I failed because it says I have to 
subscribe which just proves my bait works in making them think its a real search result hahaha.
