everything.py:

combines most of the chat scripts together so I only need to have one bind to launch and then pass the corresponding number to run
script / function as well as choosing whether it will type in team or all chat.

makes use of following scripts I'd already written:
  lobbied
  profileSkimming
  fakeInfo
 
 modules used in it:
   - time
   - pyperclip
   - Beautiful Soup
   - bs4
   - requests
   - ctypes
   - wintypes
   - shuffle
