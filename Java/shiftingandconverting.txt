this java program is to perform conversions between Decimal, Binary, Hexadecimal, Ascii and the alphabet.

I've only contained the java files so noone easily runs the whole program and solves my puzzles quickly.

It also performs Ceasar shifts using all 26 rotation numbers, a number specified or a rotation word specified. 
The reverse word function is to cipher a message so the real word can decipher it. Eg. joker is the word to decipher / rotate the text
therefore to cipher the text the inverse word of joker is required. 
has a scramble word feature to randomise order of letters in word
Has a word and letter count.
Doesn't have the functionality to perform a dictionary check to see wether a word is a real english word as would require using some
webapplications api to do it. 

I plan to update this program alot and my next task with it is removing the buttons for converting formats and replace with radio button
groups to take up a lot less space.
