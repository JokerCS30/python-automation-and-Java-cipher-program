lobbied.py

this script uses common code from autoInput and createMacro to get steam profile info. It adds each steam profile url and name to an array,
goes through each profile and if a name in the array is in friends list it prints their name. Basically prints any friends that are in the
same game under name so I can see who is lobbied with who. Useful to know sometimes if there's a 4 man who might try to kick me.
